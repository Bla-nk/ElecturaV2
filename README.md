This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


I created 2 version of the Frontend UI version for the Intern Assignment for [Electura}(https://www.electura.co/). This is the 1st version.
1. [Version1](https://github.com/Bla-nk/ElecturaV1): This version is simple looking and cart feature is implemented into it.
2. Version2: This version is very much exotic looking when compared to the V1. Will add Cart functionality to the cart page of the site later on.

Watch this video to check the website that I made in Action.
